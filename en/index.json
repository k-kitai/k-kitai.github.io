A time span (start and end) is represented with an 8 digit string. I hope the naive design (no pop-ups, transition, and visual enhancement) helps to reduce the cognitive load on users. The entire list can be exported to the clipboard, so you can paste it on other app and do further analysis over a longer time scale.\nNo strict format checking is done. For example, you can put strings that does not make sense as a time span. Items are need not be ordered chronologically. The ordering is totally upto a user.\nDeclaration This app is primaliry designed for my needs and do suffices. I don’t expect an extensive enhancement of the features of this app.\nThe developer of this app shall not be liable for any damages caused by using this app.\nPrivacy Policy MinimalDayPlanner works completely offline. No user information is collected. The text input by a user is kept inside the device and never sent outside the app.\n","date":1710852586,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710852586,"objectID":"b69bcd120462cec5d35a09047d141368","permalink":"https://k-kitai.github.io/en/project/minimaldayplanner/","publishdate":"2024-03-19T21:49:46+09:00","relpermalink":"/en/project/minimaldayplanner/","section":"project","summary":"A super simple day-planning and logging app.","tags":["App"],"title":"MinimalDayPlanner","type":"project"},{"authors":["Koki KITAI","Jiang Guo","Shenghong Ju","Shu Tanaka","Koji Tsuda","Junichiro Shiomi","Ryo Tamura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563196128,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563196128,"objectID":"366faf4e44cec365c5c3d4c7d1a2b0ce","permalink":"https://k-kitai.github.io/en/publication/2019_expanding/","publishdate":"2019-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2019_expanding/","section":"publication","summary":"Complexity of materials designed by machine learning is currently limited by the inefficiency of classical computers. We show how quantum annealing can be incorporated into automated materials discovery and conduct a proof-of-principle study on designing complex thermofunctional metamaterials consisting of SiO2, SiC, and Poly(methyl methacrylate). Empirical computing time of our quantum-classical hybrid algorithm involving a factorization machine, a rigorous coupled wave analysis, and a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer was insensitive to the problem size, while a classical counterpart experienced rapid increase. Our method was used to design complex structures of wavelength selective radiators showing much better concordance with the thermal atmospheric transparency window in comparison to existing human-designed alternatives. Our result shows that quantum annealing provides scientists gigantic computational power that may change how materials are designed.","tags":null,"title":"Expanding the horizon of automated metamaterials discovery via quantum annealing","type":"publication"}]
